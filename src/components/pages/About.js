                I graduated from Augsburg University with departmental honors and Summa Cum Laude in 2011 with a degree in Spanish.
                After graduation, I spent one year in Guatemala working at a home for children.
                I returned to Minnesota in 2012 and began my career in education, working for Minneapolis Public Schools. 
                As I earned my teaching certificate from the University of St. Thomas, I worked as an associate educator (paraprofessional).
                In 2015 I began teaching 1st/2nd grade in a bilingual classroom. 
                I taught for 3 years before taking a break and traveling to Southeast Asia with my partner for a couple of months.
                Returning from my travels I decided to give teaching one more try and taught 4th grade for one year. 
                I taught online in 2020 due to the pandemic and disovered my love for web design. 
                That's when I decided to pursue a career in web development.

                I completed a full stack coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota on December 1, 2021.
                I have a passion for design and front end web development. 
                I hope to use my skills I gained from teaching as a critical thinker and problem solver in my future position in web development.
